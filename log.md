# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: November 6, 2023

**Today's Progress:** Worked through the levels on [Flexbox Froggy](https://flexboxfroggy.com/) and continued lessons in Learn HTML & CSS on [Scrimba](https://scrimba.com). I also got more aquainted with the various channels in the Scrimba Discord.

**Thoughts:** Solid day! Nice, even mix of reading, learning and coding.

### Day 0 V2: November 21, 2023

**Today's Progress:** Made a blackjack game in [Scrimba](https://scrimba.com)'s Front-End Developer Career Path.

**Thoughts:** Feeling good with the amount of coding today. I enjoyed today's Scrimba Bootcamp meetup where we had helpful check-ins with everyone, then Paul talked a bit about nifty formatting in CSS grid.

**Link(s) to work:** No links today!
