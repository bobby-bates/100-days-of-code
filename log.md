# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: November 6, 2023

**Today's Progress:** Worked through the levels on [Flexbox Froggy](https://flexboxfroggy.com/) and continued lessons in Learn HTML & CSS on [Scrimba](https://scrimba.com). I also got more aquainted with the various channels in the Scrimba Discord.

**Thoughts:** Solid day! Nice, even mix of reading, learning and coding.
